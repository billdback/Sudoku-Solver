/**
 * The SudokuSolver is a tool that solves sudoku puzzles using a possible variety of approaches.
 * There are three ways to enter the puzzle to solve:
 * 1.  As a single line with nine sets of nine entries or spaces separated by a comma.
 * 2.  As a 9x9 grid in a file.
 * 3.  From the command line prompt, one line at a time of nine entries.
